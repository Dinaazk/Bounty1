## 📐 Design Philosophy

DreamRoom utilizes a **Glassmorphism** aesthetic, characterized by:
- **Translucency**: Frosted-glass effects using `backdrop-filter`.
- **Vibrant Gradients**: Animated background blobs for a dynamic, "alive" feel.
- **Layering**: Subtle borders and shadows to create depth in a flat UI.
- **Micro-interactions**: Mouse-tracking parallax effects on background elements.
